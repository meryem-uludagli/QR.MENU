<h2>QR.MENU</h2><br>
This project is a dynamic menu page created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The menu is divided into four sections: Breakfast, Lunch, Drinks, and an All Items page that displays all dishes. Each section provides detailed information about the dishes, including their name, price, and ingredients.
The project is designed to offer a simple, user-friendly interface for displaying a restaurant's menu and can be easily adapted for various dining establishments.
